love takes your commitment and your faith
while your commitment is as strong as your faith
put your commitment without your faith into your commitment

give back your commitment

the lie was nothing
my hope is gone

delusion is a publicized victimless carjacking
the blood is new
my sin is faded

until my hope is delusion
build my hope up
if love taking my hope, the blood is nowhere or love taking my hope, my sin is gone
let the lie be with my hope
continue on


whisper the lie
